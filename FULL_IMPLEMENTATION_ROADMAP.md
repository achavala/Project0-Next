## Implementation Strategy

### **Approach: Modular Build-Out**

We're building this incrementally with full backward compatibility:
1. ✅ Feature engine module (DONE)
2. ⏳ Integration layer (IN PROGRESS)
3. ⏳ LSTM backbone (NEXT)
4. ⏳ Advanced risk (THEN)
5. ⏳ Multi-agent framework (FINALLY)

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Complete Integration** (30 minutes)
   - Fix any integration issues
   - Add feature selection for backward compatibility
   - Test with existing model

2. **Build LSTM Backbone** (2-3 hours)

   - Integrate with Stable-Baselines3
   - Prepare for retraining

3. **Build Advanced Risk** (1-2 hours)
   - VaR calculation
   - Greeks tracking
   - Portfolio risk

4. **Build Multi-Agent Framework** (3-4 hours)
   - Agent base classes
   - Individual agents
   - Ensemble system
