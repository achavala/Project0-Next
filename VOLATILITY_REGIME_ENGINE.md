# 🌊 VOLATILITY REGIME ENGINE

**Mike Agent v3 – Ultimate Final Build**

---

## ✅ FULL VOLATILITY REGIME ENGINE INTEGRATED

**The agent now fully adapts to market regime like a $500M hedge fund desk.**

### 🎯 4 Intelligent Volatility Regimes

| Regime | VIX Range | Risk % | Max Size | Stop-Loss | Take-Profit Tiers | Behavior |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Calm** | < 18 | 10% | 30% | -15% | +30% / +60% / +120% | Aggressive sizing |
| **Normal** | 18-25 | 7% | 25% | -20% | +40% / +80% / +150% | Mike's default |
| **Storm** | 25-35 | 5% | 20% | -28% | +60% / +120% / +250% | Defensive, wide stops |
| **Crash** | > 35 | 3% | 15% | -35% | +100% / +200% / +400% | Survive & thrive |

## 🧠 How It Works

### Everything Adapts Dynamically

**When VIX changes, the agent automatically adjusts:**
1. **Risk per trade** (10% → 7% → 5% → 3%)
2. **Max position size** (30% → 25% → 20% → 15%)
3. **Stop-loss levels** (tighter → wider)
4. **Take-profit targets** (modest → monster)
5. **Trailing stops** (conservative → aggressive)

### Example Trade Flow

**Scenario: Market transitions from Normal to Storm**

1. **Entry in Normal Regime (VIX 22)**:
   - Risk: 7%
   - Max Size: 25%
   - Stop: -20%
   - TP: +40%/+80%/+150%

2. **VIX Spikes to 30 (Storm Regime)**:
   - Risk: 5% (new entries)
   - Max Size: 20% (new entries)
   - Stop: -28% (wider for existing positions)
   - TP: +60%/+120%/+250% (stretched targets)

3. **Result**:
   - ✅ Existing positions get wider stops (don't get stopped out)
   - ✅ New entries use smaller size (defensive)
   - ✅ Take-profits adapt to capture bigger moves
